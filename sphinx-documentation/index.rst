   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This site documents some of the procedures I have used to create websites. In most cases the minimum amount of code is used to demonstrate a procedure. This documenation and the code examples shown in it is implemented with the Express Application Generator. Within the Express app, reStructuredText is used with Sphinx to generate documentation. The Code Examples are generated by creating a route in Express with whatever functionality is being demonstrated. Many of the files within the Express app that are used for the Code Examples are shown. These files, together with the whole site, are pushed to a repository at https://github.com/stevespages/dev-with-steve where they can all be viewed.
